# Smart Contracts and Trustless Transactions Simulation

This repository provides a Java-based simulation illustrating how blockchain concepts
can support trustless transactions, smart contract automation, and digital governance.

## Overview
The implementation models three conceptual layers:
- Data Layer: Sensor-based immutable records simulating blockchain blocks
- Logic Layer: Smart contracts triggered by business milestones
- Governance Layer: Auditable governance events for compliance and control

The code is intended for educational and research purposes, supporting studies on
blockchain-enabled digital governance and algorithmic authority.

## Usage
Compile and run the Java file:

```bash
javac CoffeeBlockchainSimulation.java
java CoffeeBlockchainSimulation
